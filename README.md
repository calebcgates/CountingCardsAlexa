Amazon Alexa Skill without SDK

This was my first live Amazon Alexa skill.  If you've every played black jack here's a fun fact.  The more face cards there are in the deck the higher probablility there is that the dealer will bust.

Counting cards is a simple mind and memory game built in Javascript without the use of the Alexa-SDK.  
Therefore the code can be edited directly inline using lambda.

However I would recomend using the Alexa-SDK, it helps to abstract much of the foundational code which allows you as the developer to focus on what matters.
The SDK also adds useful features like `MODES` and `DynamoDB` integration.  

Feel free to fork or suggest updates.
